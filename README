This repository contains the files required to reproduce the figures and
calculations in Boylan-Kolchin (2023), Nature Astronomy; DOI
10.1038/s41550-023-01937-7; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01937-7).

This code has been tested with python3 and requires numpy, scipy, hmf, astropy,
and matplotlib, all of which can be installed via pip. The figure files are
configured to run interactively within the ipython environment via "run -i
<figure_file.py>". ipython can also be installed via pip; with minor
modifications, the ipython dependency can be removed.

The data files (*.dat) have either been provided by Labbe et al. or are
available at https://github.com/ivolabbe/red-massive-candidates and correspond
to data published in Labbe et al. (2023), Nature;
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05786-2

The matplotlibrc file should enable exact reproduction of the figures in terms
of style as well as content. Each panel of both figures is contained in a
separate file, for a total of 4 figure files (2 figures, 2 panels per figure).
